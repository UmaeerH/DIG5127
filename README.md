# Web Application and Database
Repo for our 2nd year project - developing an web application with a functional database

## Technologies of this project
The aim of this project was to use a MySQL database and the Apache Web Server in order to create a functional web application. In our project, we developed a room booking system, which saved users appointments.
Users are able to create and cancel bookings, along with report issues with any rooms.
